# ThreadLocal

Thread-local variables for Swift.


## Overview

Use the ``ThreadLocal()`` macro to define a thread-local static variable:

```swift
extension SomeType {
    @ThreadLocal
    private static var counter: Int = 0
}
```

Each thread has its own version of the variable.
On each thread, the variable is initially initialized to its default value.
When the thread is destroyed, the variable's lifetime is ended.

You can use non-trivial types with thread-local variables, and can provide a custom deallocator if needed using ``ThreadLocal(deallocator:)``.


## Installation

Add the Spezi monorepo package to your app and select the `ThreadLocal` product.

In Xcode, select **File > Add Package Dependencies...**, enter:

```text
https://github.com/SchmiedmayerLab/Spezi.git
```

Choose **Up to Next Minor Version** and enter the latest tagged `0.x` release, for example `0.1.0`.

If you manage dependencies in a `Package.swift`, add the package dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SchmiedmayerLab/Spezi.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0"))
```

Then add the product dependency to the target that needs it:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ThreadLocal", package: "Spezi")
    ]
)
```
